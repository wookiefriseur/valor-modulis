# About
Collection of Powershell modules and scripts for everyday tasks. Use at your own risk.

# Installation
After cloning the repository you can add the functions to the current terminal session through:
* dot sourcing: `. script.ps1`
* import if it's a module: `Import-Module Module-Name.psm1`

For persistent scripts, load them in your psprofile.
For automatic module import, put it into one of your `$ENV:PSModulePath`.
Use prefixes in case of naming conflicts.
