# Contributing
This repository is for my own use and I'm not expecting any interest in it,
but you never know.

Feel free to open issues with bugs or feature requests or send pull requests.

I will try to act on your feedback but I can't make any promises.

See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for feature ideas.
